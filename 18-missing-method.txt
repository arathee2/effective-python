You can define your own dict subclass with a __missing__ method in order to construct default values that must know which key was being accessed.

class Pictures(dict):
	def __missing__(self, key):
		value = open_picture(key)
		self[key] = value
		return value

pictures = Pictures()
handle = pictures[path]  # path is not a key, so it is created
