Use the nonlocal statement to indicate when a closure can modify a
variable in its enclosing scopes.

def sort_priority3(numbers, group):
	found = False
	def helper(x):
		nonlocal found
		if x in group:
			found = True  # without nonlocal, this would be a new variable inside helper(x)
			return (0, x)
		return (1, x)
	numbers.sort(key=helper)
	return found
